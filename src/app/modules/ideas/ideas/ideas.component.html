    <p>The coolest thing about being a developer is being able to build a solution to a problem or filling a newfound need and sharing it with the world. Here are a couple of my personal projects as well as some past work for clients.</p>

  <h1>Fun Projects</h1>

  <article class="container">
    <h1>Picture Perfect Pallet</h1>
    <p>This is a simple app that utilizes the Unsplash.com api to get recent/popular images and a Vibrant JS to get the dominant colors of an image to create a color palette. You can also upload your own image to create a palette. I really wanted to play with router animations and lazy load pages/components.</p>

  <h1>Clients</h1>

  <article class="container">
    <h1>Green Light Group Tours</h1>
    <p>This was a fun design to bring to life. Using Underscores as a foundation for this custom theme I had to build the backend editor to be easy enough for the client to make changes and add content to their site on their own - Advanced Custom Fields really helped with that.</p>
